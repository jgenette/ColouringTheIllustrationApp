### Welcome to **ColouringTheIllustration** ðŸŽ¨

Traditional phonological documentation often relies on (adapted versions of) the **IPA** chart, which offers a static, one-dimensional view of phonological systems without highlighting the **relative frequency of phonemes**. At the same time, the growing availability of phonologically transcribed spoken corpora provides valuable data on these frequencies. However, until now, there hasn't been an easy way to visualize frequency information on the IPA chart.

**ColouringTheIllustration** bridges this gap by allowing users to enhance phonological system documentation through **interactive data visualizations**. With this app, you can visualize phoneme frequencies from any corpus that represents a phonological system. Simply input the counts of each observed phoneme, and watch as the app transforms your data into insightful visual representations.
